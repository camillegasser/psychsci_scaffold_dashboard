## Memory data dashboard for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231158292">Gasser & Davachi (2023)</a>

Created using the `Shiny` package in `R`.

In this study, we ran a series of 3 online experiments to explore how engaging in familiar behavior during learning impacted memory. Participants completed a task where they encoded a series of objects while executing simple motor action sequences that were either **well-learned ("predictable")** or **random ("variable")**. We then examined several forms of memory performance for objects from each condition (predictable v. random).

***Across all experiments, we found that executing predictable behavior during learning selectively & robustly boosted memory for the **order** of encoded objects.***
